## Existing Features

### F01 Navigation Bar

Each page has a sticky navigation bar at the top that is fully responsive. It includes a logo linking to the Home page, as well as links to the Home, Lifehacks and Subscribe pages. The navigation bar layout is consistent across all devices, making navigation simple and intuitive. The underline appears when you move the mouse over the menu links.

For mobile devices, it transforms into a compact "hamburger menu." This dropdown menu contains the same items, displayed in a column on a semitransparent background.

<img src="assets/images/readme/menu_mobile.png" width="400">

### F02 Home page - image and call to action

On the HEPY website, the first thing the user sees is a large photo of a cute black pug wearing a bright yellow raincoat. <br>
On mobile devices, this image takes up the entire screen, and the tagline with the subscribe button is superimposed over the picture. <br>
In the desktop version, the pug's photo has a black shadow on the right and bottom sides of the screen.

<p float="left">
  <img src="assets/images/readme/f02_desktop.png" width="500" alt="dog wearing yellow raincoat"/>
  <img src="assets/images/readme/f02_mobile.png" width="200" alt="dog wearing yellow raincoat"/> 
</p>

The photo, tagline, and text clearly convey the website's concept. <br>
Simple lines and color contrasts enhance this.

A large gradient text **Subscribe** button serves as an attention-grabbing call to action, guiding users to the subscribe page.

### F03 Home page - tagline

Who does not want to make their pet happy? Everyone does.<br>
**HAPPY PET. HAPPY YOU.** <br>
is a straightforward tagline that represents a concept of HEPY website.

### F04 Home page - testimonials 

Every lifehack website should feature testimonials from individuals who have successfully tried the hacks and their pets survived, and HEPY is no different. The reviews are displayed in a clean and attractive design with circular portraits. Additionally, the layout of this section is responsive, adjusting from a horizontal to a vertical display based on the width of the screen.

<p float="left">
  <img src="assets/images/readme/f04_desktop.png" width="500" alt="horizontal testimonials"/>
  <img src="assets/images/readme/f04_mobile.png" width="200" alt="vertical testimonials"/> 
</p>

Also, every testimonial card has a light shadow if the user mouse over it.

<img src="assets/images/readme/f04_shadow.png" width="200" alt="testimonial card with light shadow" >

### F05 Home page - HEPY team message

It's great to see personal messages for website visitors, and HEPY understands that. The last section of the home page includes a warm message from the HEPY team. The picture of the 'man with an idea' is memorable and a little funny.

<img src="assets/images/readme/f05.png" width="500" alt="man with an idea" >

### F06 Footer

The footer includes links to social media, enabling user engagement across multiple platforms.
It stay fixed to the bottom of all screens.

<img src="assets/images/readme/f06.png" width="500" alt="footer with social media icons" >

### F07 Lifehack page

What is a main puprose of lifehacks website? Straightforward and clear instructions. HEPY has it for every visitor. 
In the current version, the lifehacks page has only three life hacks because it does not have search functionality or filters by hashtags, for example. It shows the page for visitors who are new to HEPY portal and do not have full access yet.

Every lifehack card includes a header section featuring an image (for tablet and desktop), a title, goal, hashtags, and a like icon. Depending on the display size, the user may see the "Materials and Duration" section either on the left-hand side of the card or after the header section.

<p float="left">
  <img src="assets/images/readme/f07_desktop.png" width="500" alt="desktop version of lifehask page"/>
  <img src="assets/images/readme/f07_mobile.png" width="200" alt="mobile version of lifehask page"/> 
</p>

As one of the upcoming features, the HEPY website could provide a count of likes for each lifehack, allowing visitors to filter and view the most popular hacks on the HEPY portal.
The current stage of the project only has mouse hover interaction with the user, which changes the heart color from white to red.

<p float="left">
  <img src="assets/images/readme/white_heart.png" width="100" alt="white heart"/> 
  <img src="assets/images/readme/red_heart.png" width="100" alt="red heart"/> 
</p>

### F08 Subscribe page

What is required to subscribe to HEPY pet lifehacks? Simply an email. Therefore, this page features a straightforward form to request a subscription. The input field checks the correctness of the provided email and will display an alert tooltip with instructions if any issues are found.

<p float="left">
  <img src="assets/images/readme/f08_alert2.png" width="200" alt="subscribtion form alert"/> 
  <img src="assets/images/readme/f08_alert1.png" width="200" alt="subscribtion form alert"/>
  <img src="assets/images/readme/f08_alert3.png" width="200" alt="subscribtion form alert"/> 
</p>

> [!NOTE]
> In the current stage of the project, without JS implementation, the only way to check the correctness of data in a POST request is to redirect to the Code Institute page.

To enhance the user experience, the Subscribe page showcases a background image of an adorable puppy wearing a fun hat. The vibrant colors of the image are consistent with the website's color palette.
To ensure that every visitor can see at least half of the adorable puppy, the subscribe page has a display with the left half of the dog's image on small displays and overlaid subscribtion form.

<p float="left">
  <img src="assets/images/readme/f08_desktop.png" width="500" alt="subscribtion form and dog with funny hat"/>
  <img src="assets/images/readme/f08_mobile.png" width="200" alt="subscribtion form and dog with funny hat"/> 
</p>

### F09 page 404

The 404 page design looks plain, even the cat's picture lacks color details. 
This gray cat seems to be ignoring you, as if it's silently questioning, "Why are you here?"
The linkable word "HEPY" in a gradient color helps users find their way back to the HEPY pet lifehacks home page.
Hover the "HEPY" link has a hover effect, it slightly grows (5%).

<p float="left">
  <img src="assets/images/readme/f09_desktop.png" width="500" alt="desktop version of 404 page with grey cat"/>
  <img src="assets/images/readme/f09_mobile.png" width="200" alt="mobile version of 404 page with grey cat"/> 
</p>
